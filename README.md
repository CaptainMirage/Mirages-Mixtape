## Description

Mirage's Mixtape is an A for Afford code, designed to streamline the process of downloading multiple videos from a YouTube playlist. Developed with the intent of simplifying the task of archiving or creating offline collections of videos, this script leverages the yt-dlp and PyTube for an efficient and user-friendly experience.

PS : its definitely not for downloading videos for yourself its for archiving them google :D


## Key Features

### 1. yt-dlp Integration
Mirage's Mixtape interacts seamlessly with the yt-dlp. and soon it will be able to download private videos with some wizard stuff!

### 2. User Interaction and Configuration
Mirage's Mixtape operates interactively, prompting users for inputs so the user itself wont ever need to change anything in the source code

### 3. can be used as an API
this program can also be used as an API since every part of the code has its own function that can be called outside of the code
