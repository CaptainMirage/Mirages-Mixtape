## Description

Mirage's Mixtape is a powerful Python script designed to streamline the process of downloading multiple videos from a YouTube playlist. Developed with the intent of simplifying the task of archiving or creating offline collections of videos, this script leverages the YouTube Data API, and `tqdm` for an efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Key Features

### 1. YouTube API Integration

Mirage's Mixtape interacts seamlessly with the YouTube Data API, allowing users to access and retrieve video details from a specified playlist. The script utilizes a YouTube API key, retrieved from the user's environment variables, to authenticate and access the required data.

### 2. Playlist Video Retrieval

The script employs the `create_youtube_client` function to establish a connection to the YouTube API. Subsequently, the `get_playlist_videos` function is responsible for extracting video links and relevant details from the specified YouTube playlist. The retrieval process is designed to handle playlists of any size, with progress visualized using the `tqdm` library.

### 3. Robust Error Handling

Mirage's Mixtape incorporates robust error-handling mechanisms. In the event of a private or inaccessible playlist, the script gracefully communicates the issue to the user and prompts for a new playlist link, ensuring a seamless user experience. Error messages for download failures are also provided, enhancing script reliability.


### 4. User Interaction and Configuration

Mirage's Mixtape operates interactively, prompting users to input the YouTube playlist link and the directory where downloaded videos should be stored. This design ensures flexibility and adaptability for various use cases.

### 7. Version Control

The script incorporates a versioning system, allowing users to identify the script's version. This enables users to stay informed about updates or changes to Mirage's Mixtape.



Mirage's Mixtape stands as a versatile tool, catering to users who seek a convenient and efficient solution for managing and downloading videos from their favorite YouTube playlists. Its seamless integration of YouTube API functionalities, coupled with thoughtful error handling and progress visualization, makes it an invaluable asset for content archiving and offline viewing purposes.
