## Description

Mirage's Mixtape is an A for Afford code, designed to streamline the process of downloading multiple videos from a YouTube playlist. Developed with the intent of simplifying the task of archiving or creating offline collections of videos, this script leverages the yt-dlp and PyTube for an efficient and user-friendly experience.

PS : its definitely not for downloading videos for yourself its for archiving them google :D


## Key Features

### 1. yt-dlp Integration
Mirage's Mixtape interacts seamlessly with the yt-dlp. and soon it will be able to download private videos with some wizard stuff!

### 2. Simple User Interaction and Configuration
Mirage's Mixtape operates interactively, prompting users for inputs so the user itself wont ever need to change anything in the source code

### 3. Beautiful GUI and TUI
i tried my best to make the TUI as beautiful and simple as possible with text only, the GUI is still a work in progress but here is a picture of the early version of it

### 3. can be used as an API
this program can also be used as an API since every part of the code has its own function that can be called outside of the code

## How To Use
#### Installation

(if you dont have python installed i have put a link in references to download)
- first make sure you have the Dependencies, either :
  - run the script named `dependencies installer.py` (not recommended)
  - or run `pip install requirements.txt` in the terminal within that folder (recommended)
- your done! 


#### Updates

- if you ever encounter an error, try updating the packages by doing the steps above or if its just an error with the download try running the file `yt-dlp installer.psh` as admin (the admin is to make sure the library installs correctly)
- if you still incounter errors try redownloading the latest version of the program, it might have just been a change in the way the library is used!
